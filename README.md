# JS_raycaster

This source code, was written by following the series of tutorials published by [**Javier Mu√±iz**](https://github.com/javiermunizyt), through his [**Youtube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS9KSwTM3FO2Ovv83W98GTg) (spoken in Spanish), through his *Javascript** and **HTML* [*Raycasting Tutorial Series*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XnQq28TRZY&list=PLmD1VB8QabXxMe8khFFnePiJnmdJn8SuR).

I tried to follow his tutorial series the best I could. However, I used **Visual Studio Code** for coding, I used [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/) for a way much better formatted code and understanding of it, appart from translating every single variable, function, class and element to English, since is the best language for international coding matters. Finally, I added a lot of comments, based on my understanding about the theory of the tutorial series.

I hope you find this code useful and if you have any possible improvements, don't hesitate on sending me **Pull-Requests**.

**Disclaimer:** Basically the whole code works as expected with one weird bug which I haven't been able to track yet. When moving close to a sprite and going forward, the sprite starts moving with the player (which was not supposed to happen). I already re-read the whole original code published [**here**](https://github.com/javiermunizyt/raycasting-html5) and having no success on finding the logic issue. I hope to eventually track the bug. If you do it first, also make a **Pull-Request**.
